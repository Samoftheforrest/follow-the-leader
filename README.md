- As a user, I would expect the game to have an appealing aesthetic that is appropriate for the game's concept.
- As a user, I would like to be able to select the game's difficulty.
- As a user, I would like the game's difficulty to increase slightly as the game progresses - to keep it engaging.
- As a user, I would like to be able to check the rules at any time during the game.
- As a user, I would like to be able to play the game using either using a keyboard or mouse/mobile clicks.

### Site Owner's Goals

### Features to be Implemented

**Hint**
- Add in a "hint" that checks whether the square right of, or below the player, has the "path" class on it, and changes the colour of the square to let the player know it is safe to walk on.

**Minesweeper Mode**
- Add in a version of the game in which there is no leader! As the player steps through the minefield, they have to hover their mouse over the surrounding squares to detect mines.
    - Add a note about how this would have to be a desktop only game because you cannot hover on smaller screen sizes.

**Multiplayer Mode**
- A version of the game in which one player is the "leader" - this player goes first and creates the path. Then, the second player has to copy the path exactly.

**Time-trial Mode**
- A version of the game which the user has to race against the clock to complete as many runs through the minefield as possible.

**Save High Scores**
- Allow users to save their highest score, and have an additional page in which displays a leaderboard of the highest scores of all players.
