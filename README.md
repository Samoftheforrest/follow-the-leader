### Features to be Implemented

**Hint**
- Add in a "hint" that checks whether the square right of, or below the player, has the "path" class on it, and changes the colour of the square to let the player know it is safe to walk on.

**Minesweeper Mode**
- Add in a version of the game in which there is no leader! As the player steps through the minefield, they have to hover their mouse over the surrounding squares to detect mines.
    - Add a note about how this would have to be a desktop only game because you cannot hover on smaller screen sizes.

**Multiplayer Mode**
- A version of the game in which one player is the "leader" - this player goes first and creates the path. Then, the second player has to copy the path exactly.
